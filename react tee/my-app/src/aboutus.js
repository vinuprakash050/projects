        Founded in 2023 by Jane Doe, XIKA has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office. When Jane first started out, her passion for eco-friendly fashion drove her to quit her day job, and gave her the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the fashion industry.

        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
